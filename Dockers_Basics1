Q>>Work with out docker: VMs for applications
---------- Needed host os --> hypervisor --> host os -->  binaries related to application

Q>With Docker?
-----------Docker engine on host os ---> assig binaries and libraries --> run the container

Q>What is the use of docker??
----------- To run the app quicky and less resource bcz of absent of host os

Q>> What is the docker?
----------  Docker is containerisation platfomr --> form Related packages and binaries and run them whihc are called as container---> can run in any platform



Q>Resource management in VM?
---------- in any vm per suppose if we provided 6 gb then vm use 4GB and left 2 gb free then 2 gb is waste
---------- in docker we can use that empty space for another container
---------- in VM for Guest os increase wait , perofrmance reduce, memorey high , stoage space high, network high absorb
-----------in docker no guest os so no need of multiple os so it is called ligh weight


Q>Integration with docker??
-----------Integration in docker is Faste, Cheap and easy scalable, using docker we can setup may instances like jenkins, puppet and more
-----------All can run in the same container or we can run them in different container which can interact with some commands
-----------we can also scallable these containers with the docker commands


Q>Difference between docker and docker engine?
-------------- In docker we have 3 components that are docker client, docker host and docker repository 
-------------- docker host + docker client = docker engine
--------------- docker clinet >> To run the docker realted commands like run, pull , build by the user, here user will interact with the docker client to perform all these activities
-------------- docker host >> docker host has 5 components 1> docker demon (whihc is docker service whihc is called dockerd) , 2> container 3> images 4> Network %> Storage
-------------- docker registry >> whihc is based in cloud , by default its docker registry to store the images for security we can create a private registry
-------------- work flow >> Docker commands -->docker demon >> docker host to create images 
-------------- after creating the images whihc we have to run by the command called docker container 
-------------- the saved images in the registery we can pull them and run in somany containers 



Docker Consepts::

Docker is a platform for developers and system admins to build, run and share applications with containers
the use of cintainers to deploy applications is called continerisation

Containerisation advantages:

1> Flexible: Any type of applications can be containerised
2>Lghtweight: Containers leverage and share the host ernal instead of insttaling the host os whihc makes more efficient in terms of system resources
3> Portable: we can run in your local, deploy to cloud and run any where 
4>LooselyCoupled: Containers are self sufficient and encapsulated, allowing you to replacce or upgrade one with out disturbing the others
5>Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas across a datacenter
5>Secure: we an secure the docker container <pending>
