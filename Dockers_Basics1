Q>>Work with out docker: VMs for applications
---------- Needed host os --> hypervisor --> host os -->  binaries related to application

Q>With Docker?
-----------Docker engine on host os ---> assig binaries and libraries --> run the container

Q>What is the use of docker??
----------- To run the app quicky and less resource bcz of absent of host os

Q>> What is the docker?
----------  Docker is containerisation platfomr --> form Related packages and binaries and run them whihc are called as container---> can run in any platform



Q>Resource management in VM?
---------- in any vm per suppose if we provided 6 gb then vm use 4GB and left 2 gb free then 2 gb is waste
---------- in docker we can use that empty space for another container
---------- in VM for Guest os increase wait , perofrmance reduce, memorey high , stoage space high, network high absorb
-----------in docker no guest os so no need of multiple os so it is called ligh weight


Q>Integration with docker??
-----------Integration in docker is Faste, Cheap and easy scalable, using docker we can setup may instances like jenkins, puppet and more
-----------All can run in the same container or we can run them in different container which can interact with some commands
-----------we can also scallable these containers with the docker commands


Q>Difference between docker and docker engine?
-------------- In docker we have 3 components that are docker client, docker host and docker repository 
-------------- docker host + docker client = docker engine
--------------- docker clinet >> To run the docker realted commands like run, pull , build by the user, here user will interact with the docker client to perform all these activities
-------------- docker host >> docker host has 5 components 1> docker demon (whihc is docker service whihc is called dockerd) , 2> container 3> images 4> Network %> Storage
-------------- docker registry >> whihc is based in cloud , by default its docker registry to store the images for security we can create a private registry
-------------- work flow >> Docker commands -->docker demon >> docker host to create images 
-------------- after creating the images whihc we have to run by the command called docker container 
-------------- the saved images in the registery we can pull them and run in somany containers 



Docker Consepts::

Docker is a platform for developers and system admins to build, run and share applications with containers
the use of cintainers to deploy applications is called continerisation

Containerisation advantages:

1> Flexible: Any type of applications can be containerised
2>Lghtweight: Containers leverage and share the host ernal instead of insttaling the host os whihc makes more efficient in terms of system resources
3> Portable: we can run in your local, deploy to cloud and run any where 
4>LooselyCoupled: Containers are self sufficient and encapsulated, allowing you to replacce or upgrade one with out disturbing the others
5>Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas across a datacenter
5>Secure: we an secure the docker container <pending>



Installing Docker>> Docker we can install in number of ways like yum, zip file ..etc


Running the containers::
------------ Runable instance of a image is called container, this container will connect with the networ

Cmmand to run the command: docker run [optios] image[:tag] [command] arg

Image: The container image to run,, by default it will pulled from the docker repository 


>>>>>A Docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container that can run on the Docker platform.
It provides a convenient way to package up applications and preconfigured server environments, 
which you can use for your own private use or share publicly with other Docker users.<<<<


TAG: A specific name for the tag usually we use tag

command: Command to run inside the container at the time of creating

Arg: Arguments to pass the when running the comand

Some available options:

-d : run the container in detached mode,, by using the run with out -d we can not run the in the backgroud means will move into the conatiner ater creating it so to keep the 
     container uo and running we have to exit from the container and have to start it again to avoide this we will use detached mode whihc makes the conatiner run in the background
 
 --name: we can provide specific name to our container, if we didn't providedthis name then container will assign a name to that container by deafault
 
 --restart: we can specify to the container that when it has to be restarted automatically, there are some optiosn for this restart 
            no : it is by default whihc means ti will never restart
            on-failure: only if the contaier fails like exit with a non zero code
            always: restart the container wether is succeeds or fails also starts the container automatically whe deamon startup we never used any wherea usualy
            
            unless-stopeed: restart the container wether is succeeds or fails also starts the container automatically whe deamon startup, unless the container was stopped manually
            
 
 -p: <host port>:<container port> : every time we have to give this while creating the container:  which expose container port by mapping it to the host port,, we can use multiple 
     ports by using the -p option multiple times
     
 -rm: automatically remove the container when exits, note:: --restarts can not use along with --rm
 
 --memory: used to set the memorey limit to the container
 
 --memory-reservation: a soft limit on memorey usage,, container will retricted to this limit if docker detects memorey contention
 
 
 
 
 Commands to work with the docker:
 
 docker ps ----->to list the containers running
 docker ps -a ----------->all container
 docker start/stop/rm <container-name>
 docker rm <image> ---------->to delete image
 docker save image > image.tar ------------ to convert the images into tar file
 docker load --input image.tar --------> to create the image from the tar file
 docker version -----> to check the version
 
 
 EXAMPLE:
 
 docker run -d --name nginx --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:80 --memorey 500M --memorey-reservatio 256M nginx
 Above comand to run the nginix container with the name nginx with the given ports/memorey/restart options
 
 
 
 Docker Logging drivers:
 
 Usually logging drivers are splunk ,json..etc
 these are called plugable frame work it is used to accss the data from the containers, 
 The Docker logging driver allows you send stdout and stderr output from your container to the hostâ€™s syslog daemon. 
 The syslog daemon on the host will then forward the logs to Loggly
 we can set options for these drivers for this we have to give some custominsed drivers from the existing drivers
 for this we have to chnge the some properties in /etc/docker/deamon.json
 to find out the drivers assigned currently by using the command docker info for specific out put
 we can check the running driver by default it is json-file
 under plugins we can find the some properties like Volume, Network and log.etc
 in log option we can check the available plugins
 to change this one change the configuration file in /etc/docker/deamon.json write the code in json to change the property
 here we can defined the sizr and driver type
 by deafault:
 
 {
   "log-driver": "json-file"
   "log-opts": {
     "max-size": "15m"
     }
 }
 
 restart the docker to get it reflet ,, check for the ther logging drives ???
 
 
 we can archive the above thing directly with run command at the time of creating the container with out editing the configuration file
 
 docker run --log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=5om -p 80:80nginx
 
 above command will do the same for the specific container
 Note: if we forgot to provide the port in run command the container will exit 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Docker File:
 -------------Docer file is used to create a docker image
 What is docker image:
 -------------Which contains software to run a container along with code and images
 How to create a docker image: 
 ------------ By using the file Dockerfile and the "D" should be in upper case and there shoudn't be any extention for this and it would be a single name, continer and images 
 are defined layered file systems,, each layer is different from the previous layer.
